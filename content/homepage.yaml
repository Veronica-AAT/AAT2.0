  paragraphs:
    - >-
      As semiconductor devices scale to sub-3nm nodes and 3D NAND exceeds 400
      layers, conventional reactive ion etching cannot deliver the required
      atomic-scale precision. Aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) causes
      rate variation in deep, narrow features — degrading the uniformity that
      advanced devices demand.
    - >-
      ALE solves this fundamentally. By decomposing the etch into self-limiting
      half-reactions, each cycle removes exactly one atomic layer regardless of
      feature depth. The etch amount depends on dose, not flux — eliminating
      ARDE at aspect ratios beyond 100:1.
    - >-
      The ALE equipment market is projected to grow from $1.36B in 2025 to
      $2.74B by 2033, driven by 3D NAND scaling and gate-all-around transistor
      adoption.
