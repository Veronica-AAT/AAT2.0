  description: >-
    Applied Angstrom Technology pushes the boundaries of semiconductor etch
    technology. Our platform combines atomic layer etching, precision gas delivery,
    and advanced plasma sources to meet the demands of next-generation device
    architectures.

      title: "Self-Limiting Chemistry"
      description: >-
        Each ALE cycle consists of two half-reactions that saturate at exactly one
        atomic layer. This self-limitation is the fundamental mechanism that enables
        atomic-scale precision independent of feature geometry.
    - icon: "Thermometer"
      title: "Thermal & Plasma Modes"
      description: >-
        Thermal ALE uses sequential gas-phase reactions for isotropic removal.
        Plasma ALE adds directional ion bombardment for anisotropic etching.
        Both modes achieve sub-nanometer etch per cycle control.

      title: "Cryogenic ALE"
      description: >-
        At -60 to -110°C, reactive gases physisorb in self-limiting monolayers.
        Combined with pulsed plasma, cryogenic ALE achieves <0.1% CD deviation
        in 3D NAND channel holes up to 10µm deep.

      title: "ARDE Elimination"
      description: >-
        Conventional RIE loses >98% of etchant flux at 100:1 aspect ratio.
        ALE converts flux-dependent etching to dose-dependent etching, making
        etch per cycle independent of feature depth.
    - icon: "Shield"
      title: "Material Selectivity"
      description: >-
        Self-limiting surface chemistry enables selectivity >100:1 between
        adjacent materials. Critical for GAA nanosheet release (SiGe vs Si)
        and multilayer NAND structures.
    - icon: "Zap"
      title: "Production Throughput"
      description: >-
        Hybrid ALE/RIE modes use ALE for critical atomic-layer steps and fast
        continuous etching for bulk removal. Pulsed plasma approaches achieve
        near-continuous throughput with ALE precision.

    - number: 1
      title: "Surface Modification"
      color: "accent"
      description: >-
        A reactive gas (e.g., Cl₂ for silicon, HF for metal oxides) is introduced
        and reacts with only the top atomic layer of the surface. The reaction
        self-terminates once the surface is fully modified — no matter how long
        the exposure continues.
    - number: 2
      title: "Purge"
      color: "primary"
      description: >-
        The chamber is purged with inert gas (Ar or N₂) to remove all unreacted
        modification species and volatile byproducts. This prevents uncontrolled
        etching and ensures clean separation between half-cycles.
    - number: 3
      title: "Removal"
      color: "accent"
      description: >-
        The modified surface layer is removed by either low-energy ion bombardment
        (plasma ALE) or a second chemical reaction (thermal ALE via ligand exchange).
        Only the modified layer is removed — the underlying material is untouched.
    - number: 4
      title: "Repeat"
      color: "primary"
      description: >-
        The cycle repeats. Each cycle removes exactly one atomic layer (typically
        0.3-1.0 nm). The total etch depth equals the number of cycles multiplied
        by the etch per cycle — digital, deterministic control at the atomic scale.
